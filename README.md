# AdvancedSeminarProject

This project is being made in unity. It is currently in progress and is no where near completion. The project idea is based around a binding of isaac style dungeon where the player must get a key to escape. Each room is filled with different monsters and the player must kill the monsters in order to escape. The catch, the players weapon will change every ten seconds.
